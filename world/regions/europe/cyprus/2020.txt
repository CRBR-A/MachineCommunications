| Telecommunication systems: | general assessment: broadband market steadily developing with one of the highest penetrations rates in theÂ region;Â despite theÂ growth of Cyprus's telecom sector, the market overall continues to be dominated by the incumbent, Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CyTA), which is still fully-owned by the state, but it is losing ground to its competition annually; improved regulatory circumstances,Â especially in relation to network interconnection and access, has given competing operators theÂ certainty to invest in network infrastructure, andÂ to launch competing services; fiber infrastructure in the early days and DSL remains the dominate access platform (2020) |

| Telecommunication systems: | note: the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively impacting telecommunications production and supply chains globally; consumer spending on telecom devices and services has also slowed due to the pandemic's effect on economies worldwide; overall progress towards improvements in all facets of the telecom industry - mobile, fixed-line, broadband, submarine cable and satellite - has moderated |
