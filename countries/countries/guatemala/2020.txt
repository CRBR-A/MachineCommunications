| Telecommunication systems: | general assessment: network centered in the city of Guatemala; one of the lowest teledensities in the region especially in the country, rural areas have no fixed-line access so mobile services adopted as necessary; state-owned telecommunications company privatized in the late 1990s opened the way for competition; steady improvement of fixed-line which has also spurred growth in mobile-cellular and broadband; open regulatory framework coupled withÂ competition and greater disposable household revenue spurs growth (2020) |
