| Telecommunication systems: | general assessment: system includes microwave radio relay, open-wire, and radiotelephone communication stations; insufficient mobile spectrum,Â and poor condition of fixed-line networksÂ hinders the development of fixed-line Internet services and leaves Burkina FasoÂ with someÂ ofÂ the most expensive telecommunications globally; mobile telephony has experiencedÂ growth,Â but below the African average; govt. proposes technology-neutralÂ licenses to boost mobile broadband connectivity and amend legislation to improve regulators and legalize the frameworkÂ governing the telecom sector (2020) |
| Telecommunication systems: | domestic: fixed-line connections stand at less than 1 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular usage 100 per 100, with multiple providers there is competition and the hope for growth from a low base; Internet penetration is 11% countrywide, but higher in urban areas (2019) |
