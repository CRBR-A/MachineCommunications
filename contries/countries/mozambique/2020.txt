| Telecommunication systems: | general assessment: the mobile segment has shown strong growth; poor fixed-line infrastructure means most Internet access is through mobile accounts;Â DSL, cable broadband, WiMAX (broadband over long distances), 3G and some fiber broadband available; first LTE services launched in 2018; govt.Â implemented legislation to enforce the registration of SIM cards; submarine cables reduced the cost of bandwidth (2020) |
| Telecommunication systems: | domestic: extremely low fixed-line teledensity contrasts with rapid growth in the mobile-cellular network; operators provide coverage that includes all the main cities and key roads; fixed-line less than 1 per 100 and 48 per 100 mobile-cellular teledensity (2019) |

| Telecommunication systems: | note: the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively impacting telecommunications production and supply chains globally; consumer spending on telecom devices and services has also slowed due to the pandemic's effect on economies worldwide; overall progress towards improvements in all facets of the telecom industry - mobile, fixed-line, broadband, submarine cable and satellite - has moderated |
